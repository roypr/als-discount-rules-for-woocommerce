## ❓ FAQ

### Does this plugin overwrite the sale prices set in WooCommerce?
No. It temporarily applies discount logic based on your rules but does not modify actual product sale prices.

### Can I apply discounts to specific product variations?
Yes, the plugin supports granular control including variation-specific rules.

### Will it conflict with other pricing or discount plugins?
While it should work with most setups, it's recommended to use this plugin on its own to avoid pricing conflicts.
