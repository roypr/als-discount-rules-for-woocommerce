A smarter, faster way to apply bulk and cart-level discounts in WooCommerce — no more editing products one-by-one.

== Description ==

**Business Discount Rules – WooCommerce** lets you create flexible discount rules for your online store — all from one easy-to-use interface. Unlike the default WooCommerce setup that requires editing each product or variation manually, this plugin centralizes discount management and saves you hours.

**Key Features:**

* **One-page discount management** – Apply discounts from a single, intuitive interface.
* **Category-based discounts** – Apply fixed or percentage discounts to entire product categories.
* **Individual product & variation discounts** – Target specific products or individual variations.
* **Cart total discounts** – Set up order-based discounts like "Spend $100, get 10% off."
* **Save time and reduce errors** – No more repetitive edits or missed sale items.

Whether you're running a site-wide promotion or targeting specific products, this plugin helps you do it efficiently and without hassle.
